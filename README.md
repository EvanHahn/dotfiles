# dotfiles

This is a collection of many of my configuration files and scripts. I've been working on these since 2012 and am still learning a lot.

- `/home` contains [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/)able directories. After installing `stow`, `stow -t "$HOME" vim` should symlink `vim`. Feel free to stow anything of the other folders in there, like `tmux` or `zsh` or `lynx`.
- `/resources` contains miscellaneous resources that might require a little work. There's usually a README.
