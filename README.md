Evan Hahn's dotfiles
====================

Made for a new machine, but should be able to be run on an existing machine and no ill fate shall befall you (but run this at your own risk!).

1. Install Git and clone this repo.
2. Go into this and `chmod +x install.sh`.
3. `./install.sh`.
4. Enjoy.

Dotfiles are found in `/resources`. If you just want to do the symlinks, run `symlink.sh` in the `script` folder.

Most of this stuff is copied from other places -- I claim no ownership of pretty much any of this stuff.
