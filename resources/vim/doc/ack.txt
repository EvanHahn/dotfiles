INTRODUCTION                                                             *ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

:Ack [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                  *:Ack*

    Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to the current
    directory) for the {pattern}.  Behaves just like the |:grep| command, but
    will open the |Quickfix| window for you.

:AckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                            *:AckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:grepadd|.  Appends the |quickfix| with the results

:LAck [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                                *:LAck*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:lgrep|.  Searches, but opens in |location-list|

:LAckAdd [options] {pattern} [{directory}]                          *:LAckAdd*

    Just like |:Ack| + |:lgrepadd|.  Searches, but appends results to
    |location-list|

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along
with the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on
a line in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching
line.
