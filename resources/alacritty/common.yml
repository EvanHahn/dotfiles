# Configuration for Alacritty, the GPU enhanced terminal emulator.

# Any items in the `env` entry below will be added as
# environment variables. Some entries may override variables
# set by alacritty itself.
#env:
  # TERM variable
  #
  # This value is used to set the `$TERM` environment variable for
  # each instance of Alacritty. If it is not present, alacritty will
  # check the local terminfo database and use 'alacritty' if it is
  # available, otherwise 'xterm-256color' is used.
  #TERM: xterm-256color

  #
  # Available values:
  # - `full`: Window with title bar and title bar buttons

  # - `transparent`: Window with title bar with transparent background and title
  #   bar buttons
  # - `buttonless`: Window with title bar with transparent background and no

  multiplier: 3

  # Faux Scrolling
  #
  # The `faux_multiplier` setting controls the number of lines the terminal

# Spaces per Tab (changes require restart)
#
# This setting defines the width of a tab in cells.

# Visual Bell
#
# Any time the BEL code is received, Alacritty "rings" the visual bell. Once
# rung, the terminal background will be set to white and transition back to the
# default background color. You can control the rate of this transition by
# setting the `duration` property (represented in milliseconds). You can also
# configure the transition function by setting the `animation` property.
#
# Values for `animation`:
#   - Ease
#   - EaseOut
#   - EaseOutSine
#   - EaseOutQuad
#   - EaseOutCubic
#   - EaseOutQuart
#   - EaseOutQuint
#   - EaseOutExpo

# Background opacity
#
# Window opacity as a floating point number from `0.0` to `1.0`.

# Mouse bindings
#
# Available fields:
# - mouse
# - action
# - mods (optional)
#
# Values for `mouse`:

#
# All available `mods` and `action` values are documented in the key binding
# section.
mouse_bindings:

mouse0:
  # Click settings
  #
  # The `double_click` and `triple_click` settings control the time
  # alacritty should wait for accepting multiple clicks as one double

  double_click: { threshold: 300 }
  triple_click: { threshold: 300 }

  # If this is `true`, the cursor is temporarily hidden when typing.
  hide_when_typing: false

  url:
    # URL launcher
    #
    # This program is executed when clicking on a text which is recognized as a URL.
    # The URL is always added to the command as the last parameter.
    launcher: open

    # URL modifiers
    #
    # These are the modifiers that need to be held down for opening URLs when clicking
    # on them. The available modifiers are documented in the key binding section.
    modifiers: Control

selection:

  #
  # Values for 'style':
  #   - ▇ Block
  #   - _ Underline
  #   - | Beam
  style: Block

  # If this is `true`, the cursor will be rendered as a hollow box when the
  # window is not focused.

# Live config reload (changes require restart)

# Shell
#
# You can set `shell.program` to the path of your favorite shell, e.g. `/bin/fish`.
# Entries in `shell.args` are passed unmodified as arguments to the shell.
#shell:
#  program: /bin/bash
#  args:
#    - --login

# Key bindings
#
# Key bindings are specified as a list of objects. Each binding will specify
# a key and modifiers required to trigger it, terminal modes where the binding
# is applicable, and what should be done when the key binding fires. It can
# either send a byte sequnce to the running application (`chars`), execute
# a predefined action (`action`) or fork and execute a specified command plus
# arguments (`command`).
#
# Example:
#   `- { key: V, mods: Command, action: Paste }`
#
# Available fields:
#   - key
#   - mods (optional)
#   - chars | action | command (exactly one required)
#   - mode (optional)
#
# Values for `key`:
#   - `A` -> `Z`
#   - `F1` -> `F12`
#   - `Key1` -> `Key0`
#
#   A full list with available key codes can be found here:
#   https://docs.rs/glutin/*/glutin/enum.VirtualKeyCode.html#variants
#
#   Instead of using the name of the keys, the `key` field also supports using
#   the scancode of the desired key. Scancodes have to be specified as a
#   decimal number.
#   This command will allow you to display the hex scancodes for certain keys:
#     `showkey --scancodes`
#
# Values for `mods`:
#   - Command
#   - Control
#   - Shift
#   - Alt
#
#   Multiple `mods` can be combined using `|` like this: `mods: Control|Shift`.
#   Whitespace and capitalization is relevant and must match the example.
#
# Values for `chars`:
#   The `chars` field writes the specified string to the terminal. This makes
#   it possible to pass escape sequences.
#   To find escape codes for bindings like `PageUp` ("\x1b[5~"), you can run
#   the command `showkey -a` outside of tmux.
#   Note that applications use terminfo to map escape sequences back to
#   keys. It is therefore required to update the terminfo when
#   changing an escape sequence.
#
# Values for `action`:
#   - Paste
#   - PasteSelection
#   - Copy
#   - IncreaseFontSize
#   - DecreaseFontSize
#   - ResetFontSize
#   - ScrollPageUp
#   - ScrollPageDown
#   - ScrollToTop
#   - ScrollToBottom
#   - ClearHistory
#   - Hide
#   - Quit
#
# Values for `command`:
#   The `command` field must be a map containing a `program` string and
#   an `args` array of command line parameter strings.
#
#   Example:
#       `command: { program: "alacritty", args: ["-e", "vttest"] }`
#
# Values for `mode`:
#   - ~AppCursor
#   - AppCursor
#   - ~AppKeypad
#   - AppKeypad
